Maven - Build automation tool

build is a version of application /spftware which is ready for testing 

why we need Maven - To create build of project , helps to maintain and proper folder structure of project with the help of pom.xml , 
                   


pom.xml - Project object model , Its a heart of of maven 
          1. info and configuration details are avaialable 
          2. No need to download external jars to project , with the help of pom xml all dependencies can be downloaded 
          

maven repository - central reposotory where we download all depenndency which are necessary 



Flow of dependency add
___________________________

pom.xml ----> maven central repo -----> maven dependency [local repo]
